    fix: fix unhandled NVENCException's occuring during initialization & reconfigure calls (#877)

    * fix: fix unhandled NVENCException's occuring during initialization & reconfigure calls

    In rare cases, the encoder will throw a NVENCException with error code 8 during the creation & reconfigure calls.
    Error code 8 indicates invalid parameters, but in these cases the parameters are valid, and the exceptions seem to occur within the nvidia code.
    Adding exception handling around these calls to prevent applications from crashing due to an unhandled exception.

    * chore: update native plugins
